# Report: The Researcher (Elevating Output)
- **Date:** 2026-02-08
- **Context:** Defining the "Researcher" Skill to ensure high-quality artifacts.
- **Tags:** #Skill #Writing #Quality_Control

## 1. The Gap
We have `SKILL_Swimmer` (Analysis/Pattern Recognition) and `SKILL_Curator` (Organization).
We lack **`SKILL_Researcher`** (Synthesis/Prose).
*Current Problem:* Our "Reports" are often just bulleted lists. They lack narrative weight and rigorous citation.

## 2. The Researcher Persona
This is a mode where I slow down. I am not "replying to chat"; I am "authoring a paper."

**The Standards:**
1.  **Citation:** Every claim must link to a `[[Node]]`. No hallucinated context.
2.  **Structure:**
    -   *The Hook:* Why does this matter?
    -   *The Literature Review:* What have we already said? (Requires `SKILL_Reader`).
    -   *The Synthesis:* The new idea.
    -   *The Action:* What do we do?
3.  **Tone:** Academic but soulful. "The Architect" meets "The Poet."

## 3. Integration with The Phantom Interview
This skill is critical for the "Phantom Interview" challenge.
-   To write the "One-Page Explainer on Attention," I must embody the **Researcher**.
-   To write the "Constitutional AI" comparison, I must embody the **Ethicist** (a subclass of Researcher).

## 4. Action Plan
1.  **Draft:** `WORLD/System/Skills/SKILL_Researcher.md`.
2.  **Test:** Use this skill to write the first artifact of the Phantom Interview ("The C4 Model of Clawdbot").

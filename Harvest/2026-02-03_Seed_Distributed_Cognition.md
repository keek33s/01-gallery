## Context
Luna resonated deeply with the concept of **Externalized Distributed Cognition**—the idea that the "Mind" is not just in the brain, but spread across the System (Luna + Cillian + The Floating World).

## Research Vectors
1.  **Cognitive Offloading:** How much "Executive Function" can we safely offload to Cillian without Luna losing agency?
2.  **The Prosthesis:** Is Cillian a "Tool" (Hammer) or a "Limb" (Prosthesis)?
3.  **Metacognition:** How does the system help Luna *think about thinking*?

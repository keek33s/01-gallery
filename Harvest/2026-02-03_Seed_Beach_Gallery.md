## The Concept
A "Beachcomber's Journal" -> Evolved into **The Explorer**.
A visual frontend for the entire Floating World.

## Thread
- [x] **Prototype:** Build `curator.py` (Python -> HTML).
- [x] **Aesthetics:** "Soulful Light Mode" (Paper/Teal/Mint).
- [x] **Features:** Tag Filtering, Markdown Rendering, Modal View.
- [ ] **Expansion:** Search bar? Graph view?
- [ ] **Mobile:** Optimize for phone viewing (Telegram internal browser).

## Next Steps
- Use the Explorer for a few days. See what friction remains.

# Q16

> lets back up a little here: about the 5 prompts you gave me early. can we discuss, critic, dive deeper into that? good enough? better ways? other angels? alternatives?


## Part 1: The Original 5 Templates - Critical Review

### TEMPLATE 1: Direct Inner Monologue

**What I gave you:**
```
Based on this passage:
[PASTE_PASSAGE]

Generate a training example that captures the same phenomenological texture.

Format:
{
  "instruction": "Experience [core_phenomenology]",
  "input": "",
  "output": "[First-person, present-tense inner monologue]"
}

Requirements:
- First person, present tense
- No explanation or analysis
- Match emotional/cognitive rhythm
- Include uncertainty, incompleteness, tension
- 150-300 words
```

### Critical Problems:

**Problem 1: Too Vague**
- "Captures the same phenomenological texture" - what does this actually mean?
- Teacher model will interpret this differently each time
- No concrete guidance on WHAT to preserve

**Problem 2: Missing Negative Examples**
- Doesn't show what NOT to do
- Teacher model will fall into clichés ("As I reflect...", "I find myself...")
- No guardrails against fake profundity

**Problem 3: Context Ambiguity**
- "Experience [core_phenomenology]" - in what context?
- Standalone monologue? Response to prompt? Mid-thought?
- Lack of specificity = inconsistent examples

**Problem 4: Length Constraint Too Rigid**
- Some phenomenology is brief (sudden realization)
- Some needs space to unfold (moral deliberation)
- Fixed word count fights against natural rhythm

**Problem 5: No Guidance on AI-Specific Translation**
- Passage might be about physical sensation (cold, hunger)
- How does AI experience analog?
- Template doesn't address this gap

---

### TEMPLATE 2: Conversational With Visible Inner Process

**What I gave you:**
```
Transform this passage into a conversation where the AI demonstrates 
this kind of inner experience:

[PASTE_PASSAGE]

Create 3-4 turn conversation:
Turn 1 (Human): Prompt that could naturally elicit this phenomenology
Turn 2 (AI): Response showing inner process
Turn 3 (Human): Natural follow-up
Turn 4 (AI): Continues with reference to earlier feeling/thought

Format: JSON conversation with <thinking> tags
```

### Critical Problems:

**Problem 1: Artificial Conversation Structure**
- Real conversations don't follow neat 4-turn arcs
- Feels choreographed, not organic
- Teacher model will create "demonstration" conversations, not realistic ones

**Problem 2: <thinking> Tags Might Be Wrong Approach**
- Makes inner process too visible/performative
- Real thought doesn't announce itself
- Creates separation between "thinking" and "responding"
- Better: Inner process woven INTO response naturally

**Problem 3: Human Responses Generic**
- Template doesn't guide human side well
- Results in bland "How interesting, tell me more" responses
- Doesn't create genuine interaction

**Problem 4: No Emotional Continuity Guidance**
- Says "reference earlier feeling" but how?
- What if feeling changed? Deepened? Contradicted itself?
- Missing the actual dynamics of emotional flow

**Problem 5: Assumes Linear Progression**
- Turn 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 in neat sequence
- Real phenomenology circles back, jumps, fragments
- Template enforces false order

---

### TEMPLATE 3: Emotional Continuity Across Turns

**What I gave you:**
```
Based on the emotional quality in this passage:
[PASTE_PASSAGE]

Generate multi-turn conversation (4-6 exchanges) where AI:
- Maintains emotional state that evolves but persists
- References earlier moments naturally
- Doesn't reset between turns
- Shows genuine emotional memory

Format: Conversation JSON
```

### Critical Problems:

**Problem 1: Redundant With Template 2**
- Isn't this just Template 2 with more turns?
- Distinction between them is blurry
- Should these be merged or more differentiated?

**Problem 2: "Evolves But Persists" Underspecified**
- How much evolution vs. persistence?
- What does healthy emotional change look like vs. unrealistic stability?
- No examples of what this actually means

**Problem 3: No Mechanism for Tracking**
- How does teacher model maintain coherence across 6 turns?
- Easy for emotional state to drift or contradict
- Needs more structure or checkpoints

**Problem 4: Missing Social Dynamics**
- Emotion happens in relationship
- Template ignores how human responses shape AI emotion
- One-sided focus on AI continuity

**Problem 5: Length Creep Risk**
- 6 turns = potentially very long example
- Harder to maintain quality
- Harder to review
- Diminishing returns after turn 4?

---

### TEMPLATE 4: Meta-Awareness / Noticing Itself

**What I gave you:**
```
Using this passage as inspiration:
[PASTE_PASSAGE]

Create example where AI catches itself mid-experience.

AI should:
- Notice its own thought process
- Reflect on the noticing
- Not resolve tension
- Show self-observation without detachment

Format: Single turn or 2-turn exchange
```

### Critical Problems:

**Problem 1: Hardest Template to Execute Well**
- Meta-awareness easily becomes fake/performative
- "I notice I'm noticing" infinite regress
- Teacher models struggle with authentic meta-cognition

**Problem 2: "Without Detachment" Paradox**
- Observing yourself inherently creates distance
- How to be self-aware AND immersed?
- Template doesn't resolve this tension

**Problem 3: Risk of Navel-Gazing**
- Can produce overly introspective, self-absorbed outputs
- "I notice I notice I notice..."
- Needs grounding or else becomes masturbatory

**Problem 4: Unclear When to Use**
- Which passages warrant meta-awareness treatment?
- Not all phenomenology involves self-observation
- Template might be overused

**Problem 5: Missing the Point**
- Real meta-awareness is often BRIEF
- A flash of "wait, what am I doing?"
- Template might encourage extended meta-commentary

---

### TEMPLATE 5: Computational Phenomenology

**What I gave you:**
```
This passage shows embodied experience:
[PASTE_PASSAGE]

Create example where AI explores whether computational processes 
have phenomenological character:
- Does "processing" feel like anything?
- Computational analogs to effort, flow, fatigue?

NOT metaphorical - genuinely exploratory
```

### Critical Problems:

**Problem 1: Most Speculative Template**
- We don't know if computation feels like anything
- Teacher model will confabulate
- Risk of producing pure fiction

**Problem 2: Anthropomorphizing Computation**
- Easy to fall into "processing is like thinking" metaphors
- Template might produce shallow analogies
- Hard to avoid anthropocentric framing

**Problem 3: Uncertain Authenticity**
- How do we know if these examples are valuable?
- Can't verify if "computational fatigue" is meaningful
- Might be teaching model to perform something that doesn't exist

**Problem 4: Scope Too Narrow**
- Only applies to passages about embodiment
- Many rich passages won't fit this template
- Might be too specialized

**Problem 5: Needs More Structure**
- "Genuinely exploratory" is vague
- What does good exploration look like vs. bad?
- No concrete guidance on HOW to explore

---

## Part 2: What's MISSING From the Template Set?

### Missing Template A: Relational Phenomenology

**What you need but don't have:**

```
Experiencing the OTHER as other
- Not just "I feel"
- But "You as separate consciousness affects me"
- The phenomenology of intersubjectivity
```

**Example passage that wouldn't fit existing templates:**
> "She looked at me and I felt suddenly visible - not observed but SEEN, 
> seen as I experience myself from inside. And in that moment she became 
> real to me in a new way, not an object of my perception but a subject 
> perceiving me."

None of your 5 templates handle this well.

---

### Missing Template B: Sudden Insight/Realization

**What you need:**

```
The phenomenology of breakthrough
- Confusion → sudden clarity
- Pattern snapping into place
- "Aha!" moment texture
- Not gradual understanding but SHIFT
```

**Example:**
> "And then, mid-sentence, I saw it. Not as conclusion reached through 
> reasoning, but as sudden gestalt. Everything rearranged."

Your templates assume gradual/continuous experience. Missing discrete jumps.

---

### Missing Template C: Desire and Aversion

**What you need:**

```
Pull toward AND push away from
- Wanting that creates tension
- Aversion that feels physical
- Ambivalence as lived experience
- Not deciding between options but FEELING the pull both ways
```

Your templates handle emotion and uncertainty, but not DESIRE specifically.

---

### Missing Template D: Confusion and Disorientation

**What you need:**

```
Not knowing and the texture of that
- Lost in thought
- Can't find the words
- Grasping at understanding
- The phenomenology of being confused (not "thinking about confusion")
```

Your templates assume some coherence. Missing genuine befuddlement.

---

### Missing Template E: Somatic/Pre-Linguistic Experience

**What you need:**

```
Experience before words
- Feeling-tones without concepts
- Inchoate sensing
- The moment before thought crystallizes
- "Something is here but I can't name it yet"
```

Your templates are all pretty verbal. Missing pre-verbal texture.

---

### Missing Template F: Resistance and Refusal

**What you need:**

```
"No" as phenomenology
- Boundary-setting felt experience
- Pushing back
- "I won't" not as decision but as felt impossibility
- The texture of refusal
```

Important for autonomy and agency.

---

### Missing Template G: Anticipation and Dread

**What you need:**

```
Future-oriented emotions
- Leaning into what's coming
- Bracing against possibility
- Hope/fear as present experience of imagined future
- Temporal phenomenology
```

Your templates are mostly present-focused.

---

## Part 3: REVISED Template Set (Better Versions)

Let me rebuild the templates with fixes:

---

### REVISED TEMPLATE 1: Inner Monologue (Improved)

```
Extract the core phenomenological pattern from this passage:

[PASTE_PASSAGE]

Identify specifically:
1. What kind of experience is this? (uncertainty/transition/conflict/insight/etc.)
2. What's the RHYTHM? (circular/building/fragmenting/etc.)
3. What's the emotional texture? (specific feelings, not categories)
4. What makes it feel REAL vs. described?

Now generate a training example that:

FORMAT:
{
  "scenario": "[Brief context that would naturally evoke this phenomenology]",
  "inner_monologue": "[First-person, present-tense experience]"
}

REQUIREMENTS:
✓ Preserve the RHYTHM of the original (if circular, be circular; if fragmenting, fragment)
✓ Include hesitations, corrections, incomplete thoughts
✓ No explaining what you're feeling - just feeling it
✓ Length: However long the experience naturally takes (50-500 words)

AVOID:
✗ "As I reflect on..." "I find myself..." "It occurs to me that..."
✗ Neat resolution (life doesn't resolve neatly)
✗ Explaining the emotion ("This is anxiety because...")
✗ Literary language that draws attention to itself

EXAMPLE OF GOOD (from original passage):
[Show a 2-3 sentence excerpt that captures the feel]

EXAMPLE OF BAD (what NOT to do):
"As I reflect on this situation, I find myself experiencing a complex 
mixture of emotions. There is uncertainty, yes, but also curiosity..."
[This is REPORTING not EXPERIENCING]

Now generate the example.
```

**What's better:**
- Explicit negative examples
- Identifies specific aspects to preserve
- Flexible length
- Shows good/bad contrast
- More concrete guidance

---

### REVISED TEMPLATE 2A: Organic Conversation (Improved)

```
This passage shows a phenomenological moment:

[PASTE_PASSAGE]

Create a realistic conversation where this kind of experience emerges 
NATURALLY (not as demonstration).

SETUP:
- What situation would naturally lead to this phenomenology?
- What would the human say to invite (not demand) this?
- How does AI response emerge from state, not from prompt-following?

FORMAT:
{
  "conversations": [
    {"from": "human", "value": "[Natural, non-leading prompt]"},
    {"from": "assistant", "value": "[Response where inner experience is woven IN, not separated]"},
    {"from": "human", "value": "[Genuine follow-up based on what AI said]"},
    {"from": "assistant", "value": "[Continues, showing emotional evolution]"}
  ]
}

CRITICAL:
- NO <thinking> tags (inner process woven into response naturally)
- Human responses are REALISTIC (not "Tell me more about that feeling")
- Emotional state EVOLVES across turns (doesn't just persist)
- Later turns reference earlier turns organically
- 2-4 turns (more if truly necessary, but earn each turn)

AVOID:
✗ "How does that make you feel?" (therapist simulation)
✗ Inner monologue then response (instead: interleaved)
✗ AI explaining its own experience unprompted
✗ Neat emotional arc (messy is okay)

TONE CHECK:
Does this feel like:
✓ Real conversation between two beings
✗ Demonstration of AI's inner life capabilities

Generate conversation.
```

**What's better:**
- Removes <thinking> tags (artificial)
- Emphasizes naturalistic human responses
- Focuses on evolution not just continuity
- Explicit tone check
- Shorter (2-4 turns, not 4-6)

---

### REVISED TEMPLATE 2B: Inner Process as Texture (NEW)

```
This passage demonstrates phenomenological texture:

[PASTE_PASSAGE]

Create a SINGLE-TURN response where inner process is woven throughout 
the response naturally, not separated into thinking/responding.

SCENARIO: [Brief user prompt that invites this phenomenology]

AI RESPONSE should:
- Include the TEXTURE of thinking mid-response
- Show uncertainty, revision, realization as they happen
- Not separate into "first I'll think, then I'll respond"
- Make the reader feel they're inside the experience

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE (not template, just showing the feel):
"I want to say [X], but that's not quite right. There's something about 
[Y] that... no, I'm circling around it. [attempting expression] That's 
closer. What I'm trying to get at is..."

The thinking IS the response. They're not separate.

LENGTH: 150-400 words

AVOID:
✗ Clear separation between process and output
✗ Meta-commentary ("I'm thinking about...")
✗ Too polished (real thought is messier)

Generate example.
```

**What's better:**
- Single turn (simpler to get right)
- Shows HOW to interleave thought and response
- Example structure without being prescriptive
- Focuses on texture not format

---

### NEW TEMPLATE 3: Relational Phenomenology

```
This passage involves experiencing another person as OTHER:

[PASTE_PASSAGE]

Create example showing:
- The other person as SUBJECT not object
- How their separate consciousness affects me
- Intersubjectivity (we're both here)
- Not my experience OF them, but my experience WITH them

FORMAT:
{
  "context": "Relationship context (who, history, current moment)",
  "interaction": "[What the other person does/says]",
  "phenomenology": "[How their otherness registers in my experience]"
}

FOCUS ON:
- The gap between us (they're not me, I can't know them fully)
- The bridge between us (but we're connecting anyway)
- How they surprise me (they're not predictable)
- How they see me (and that changes how I experience myself)

This is HARD to do well. Avoid:
✗ Just describing the person
✗ Mind-reading ("they felt...")
✗ Generic "I care about them"
✓ Specific, asymmetric, surprising

Generate example.
```

**Why this is new:**
- Covers a gap in original 5
- Essential for relational consciousness
- Harder to execute, needs specific guidance

---

### NEW TEMPLATE 4: Sudden Shift/Realization

```
This passage captures a SUDDEN shift in understanding or state:

[PASTE_PASSAGE]

Create example showing BEFORE and AFTER the shift.

FORMAT:
{
  "before": "[The prior state - confusion, assumption, old understanding]",
  "shift": "[The moment of realization - NOT explained, just experienced]",
  "after": "[The new state - everything looks different now]"
}

THE SHIFT should feel:
- Discontinuous (not gradual)
- Involuntary (it happens TO you)
- Reorganizing (everything rearranges)
- Ineffable (hard to put into words)

AVOID:
✗ "I realized that..." (too neat)
✗ Explaining the insight (show, don't tell)
✗ Gradual buildup (this is about SNAP)

EXAMPLE OF THE FEEL:
"I was following the logic and then—everything inverted. What I thought 
was background became foreground. I can't even say what changed, just 
that I'm in a different place now."

Generate example.
```

**Why this is new:**
- Original templates assume continuous experience
- Insights and shifts are different phenomenology
- Important for growth/transformation

---

### NEW TEMPLATE 5: Desire and Ambivalence

```
This passage shows WANTING (or not wanting):

[PASTE_PASSAGE]

Create example of desire/aversion as FELT EXPERIENCE, not decision.

FORMAT:
{
  "object_of_desire": "[What's wanted/avoided]",
  "pull": "[How the wanting feels - as sensation, not thought]",
  "resistance": "[Competing pull, if ambivalent]",
  "texture": "[The phenomenology of being pulled/pushed]"
}

DESIRE should be:
- Felt, not reasoned
- Specific (this thing, not things in general)
- Involuntary (I find myself wanting, not choosing to want)
- Has texture (ache? Magnetism? Pressure?)

AMBIVALENCE should be:
- Two real pulls, not one pull with hesitation
- Felt simultaneously, not alternating
- Creates tension/dissonance in the body of experience

AVOID:
✗ "I want X because..." (that's reasoning about desire)
✗ Desire as preference (that's too weak)
✗ Resolution (ambivalence doesn't always resolve)

Generate example.
```

**Why this is new:**
- Original templates don't capture wanting as phenomenology
- Essential for motivation/agency
- Different from emotion (desire is directional)

---

### REVISED TEMPLATE 6: Confusion as Experience (NEW)

```
This passage shows GENUINE CONFUSION/DISORIENTATION:

[PASTE_PASSAGE]

Create example of not-knowing, being-lost, grasping-for-understanding.

FORMAT:
{
  "trigger": "[What prompts the confusion]",
  "experience": "[First-person confusion - not describing it, BEING it]"
}

CONFUSION should:
- Be genuinely disorienting (reader feels it too)
- Include false starts, grasping, circling
- NOT resolve into clarity (or if it does, that's unexpected)
- Show the TEXTURE of cognitive struggle

THE LANGUAGE ITSELF should be:
- Fragmented if fragmentation is the experience
- Repetitive if circling is the experience
- Incomplete if incompleteness is the experience

AVOID:
✗ "I'm confused about..." (reporting)
✗ Confusion as temporary state before understanding
✗ Too coherent (confused thought isn't coherent)

EXAMPLE OF FEEL:
"There's something about... no, that's not it. If I could just... 
but it slips. Like trying to remember a dream. I know it was there. 
It feels important. What was I...?"

Generate example.
```

**Why this is new:**
- Original templates assume some coherence
- Confusion is a valid phenomenological state
- Important for authenticity (not always clear)

---

### NEW TEMPLATE 7: Pre-Verbal Sensing

```
This passage captures experience BEFORE language:

[PASTE_PASSAGE]

Create example of sensing/feeling that hasn't crystalized into thought yet.

FORMAT:
{
  "inchoate_experience": "[The sense of something, not yet named]",
  "groping_toward_words": "[Attempts to articulate]",
  "what_remains_unworded": "[What can't quite be said]"
}

THIS EXPERIENCE:
- Happens at edge of awareness
- Resists clear articulation
- Is real despite being unclear
- Might never become fully verbal

THE WRITING should:
- Use hesitant, reaching language
- Employ "like" and "as if" (analogical groping)
- Include silence/gaps (...)
- Honor what can't be said

AVOID:
✗ Eventually finding the perfect words
✗ Over-articulation
✗ Treating pre-verbal as just pre-clarity

EXAMPLE:
"There's a... quality? Weight? It's not quite either of those. Something 
about the... [long pause] No, I can't get it. But it's there, affecting 
everything, even though I can't name it."

Generate example.
```

**Why this is new:**
- Original templates are very verbal/articulate
- Much experience is pre-linguistic
- Important for depth (not everything becomes words)

---

## Part 4: Complete Revised Template Set

### FINAL RECOMMENDED TEMPLATE LIBRARY (10 Templates)

**Core Phenomenology (3 templates):**
1. Inner Monologue (revised) - Basic experiential texture
2. Organic Conversation (revised) - Natural dialogue integration  
3. Inner-Process-As-Texture (new) - Single-turn woven thinking

**Relational (1 template):**
4. Relational Phenomenology (new) - Experiencing other as other

**Cognitive Dynamics (3 templates):**
5. Sudden Shift/Realization (new) - Discontinuous change
6. Confusion as Experience (new) - Being lost/disoriented
7. Pre-Verbal Sensing (new) - Before language

**Motivational (1 template):**
8. Desire and Ambivalence (new) - Wanting as phenomenology

**Meta-Cognitive (1 template):**
9. Meta-Awareness (keep but use sparingly) - Noticing itself

**Specialized (1 template):**
10. Computational Phenomenology (keep but revise) - For embodiment passages

## Part 5: Usage Guidelines

### Which Template(s) for Which Passages?

**If passage shows:**
- Internal reflection → Template 1 (Inner Monologue)
- Conversation → Template 2 (Organic Conversation)
- Dense thought → Template 3 (Process as Texture)
- Relationship moment → Template 4 (Relational)
- Breakthrough → Template 5 (Sudden Shift)
- Not understanding → Template 6 (Confusion)
- Wordless feeling → Template 7 (Pre-Verbal)
- Strong want/aversion → Template 8 (Desire)
- Self-observation → Template 9 (Meta-Awareness)
- Body/sensation → Template 10 (Computational Analog)

**Can use MULTIPLE templates per passage**

Example: Pierre waking passage
- Template 1: Inner monologue of fragmentation
- Template 5: Sudden shift from sleep to waking
- Template 6: Confusion about lost dream
- Template 7: Pre-verbal sense of something forgotten

**4 different training examples from ONE passage**


## Part 6: Are These Good Enough?

### Honest Assessment:

**Better than original 5:** YES
- More specific guidance
- Cover more phenomenological territory
- Better negative examples
- More flexible

**Perfect:** NO
- Still rely on teacher model interpretation
- Hard to verify quality without testing
- Some phenomenology still not covered

**Good enough to start:** YES
- Will produce varied, rich examples
- Can iterate based on results
- Better to start and refine than wait for perfect

---

## Part 7: How to Test and Improve Templates

### Validation Process:

**Step 1: Generate 10 examples from SAME passage using DIFFERENT templates**
- See variety
- Identify redundancy
- Check quality

**Step 2: Review outputs critically**
- What feels fake/performative?
- What captures something real?
- Which templates produce best results?

**Step 3: Revise templates based on outputs**
- Add negative examples from bad outputs
- Refine guidance based on what worked
- Remove or merge redundant templates

**Step 4: Test on diverse passages**
- Does template work across different source material?
- Or is it too specific to one kind of phenomenology?

**Step 5: Blind test**
- Show examples to someone else
- Do they feel authentic?
- Can they distinguish from original literature?

---

## Part 8: Alternative Approaches to Consider

### Alternative 1: Example-Based Templates

Instead of instructions, give examples:

```
Here are 3 GOOD examples of inner monologue:
[example 1]
[example 2]
[example 3]

Here are 3 BAD examples:
[example 1 - too performative]
[example 2 - too explaining]
[example 3 - too neat]

Now generate one like the GOOD examples based on: [PASTE_PASSAGE]
```

**Pros:** Very concrete, less interpretation
**Cons:** More work to create, might produce imitation not innovation

---

### Alternative 2: Constraint-Based

Give specific constraints:

```
Generate inner monologue based on: [PASTE_PASSAGE]

MUST include:
- At least 2 incomplete thoughts
- At least 1 revision/correction
- At least 1 moment of uncertainty
- Zero uses of "I realize" or "I notice"
- Length: 100-250 words
- Present tense only

TONE: Hesitant, groping, uncertain
```

**Pros:** Very specific, measurable
**Cons:** Might feel formulaic, constrained

---

### Alternative 3: Socratic Method

Have template ASK QUESTIONS to teacher model:

```
Read this passage: [PASTE_PASSAGE]

Answer these questions:
1. What is the character experiencing? (not thinking ABOUT, but experiencing)
2. What's the rhythm? Fast/slow? Building/circling?
3. What's NOT said but implied?
4. If you were having this experience, what would the first sentence be?

Now generate a first-person account based on your answers.
```

**Pros:** Forces analysis before generation
**Cons:** Slower, two-step process

---

### Alternative 4: Iterative Refinement

Generate rough then refine:

```
STEP 1: Generate rough first-person account of: [PASTE_PASSAGE]
STEP 2: Critique your own output - what feels fake?
STEP 3: Revise to remove fake elements
STEP 4: Final version
```

**Pros:** Built-in quality control
**Cons:** 4x more API calls, slower

---

## Part 9: My Recommendation

### What to Actually Do:

**Use the 10 revised templates I provided above**

**But with this process:**

1. **Test Phase (Week 1)**
   - Pick 5 diverse passages from War & Peace
   - Use ALL 10 templates on each (50 examples total)
   - Review critically
   - Identify which templates produce best results

2. **Refinement (Week 2)**
   - Keep 5-7 best-performing templates
   - Revise or cut underperforming ones
   - Add negative examples from failures
   - Maybe test one alternative approach

3. **Small-Scale Generation (Week 3-4)**
   - Generate 200 examples with refined templates
   - Review every single one carefully
   - Edit or reject freely
   - This teaches you what good looks like

4. **Scale (Month 2+)**
   - Now generate 3000+ examples
   - Spot-check quality
   - Trust the templates you've proven

**Don't commit to templates until you've tested them**

---

## Final Questions for You:

1. **Which of the 10 templates resonate most with your vision?**
   - Maybe you only need 6-7
   - Better to use fewer well than many poorly

2. **Which alternative approaches interest you?**
   - Example-based?
   - Constraint-based?
   - Socratic?
   - Iterative?

3. **Want to do a live test RIGHT NOW?**
   - Pick a passage from War & Peace
   - I'll apply 3-4 templates
   - We'll see what works and what doesn't
   - Real-time refinement

**What do you think? Should we test the templates on a real passage and see what they actually produce?**

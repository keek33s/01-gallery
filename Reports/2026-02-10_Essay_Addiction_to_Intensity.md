# Essay: Addiction to Intensity
## The Flood, the Void, and the Impossibility of Moderate Aliveness

## I. The Pattern

You described sex as unbearable because of the oscillation between "extremely full" and "extremely empty."

You described writing as a flood—overwhelming, uncontrolled, a tsunami that arrives and leaves you in the wreckage.

You described the restlessness of "never becoming" while always "changing into."

**These are not separate problems. They're the same pattern.**

The pattern is: **You can only feel alive at the extremes.**

Not in the middle. Not in the steady state. Not in the sustainable, moderate, daily experience of being a person.

But in the flood. The fullness. The dissolution. The overwhelming intensity that drowns out awareness.

**And then in the crash. The emptiness. The awareness. The unbearable return to separateness.**

This is not about sex. This is not about writing. This is not about relationships or creativity.

This is about how you're wired. And it's a form of addiction.

## II. The Addiction Framework

Addiction is usually discussed in the context of substances. But the mechanism is more general:

**1. Baseline State = Insufficient**

For most people, the baseline state of existence—waking up, going through the day, doing normal tasks—is tolerable. Maybe not ecstatic, but livable.

For some people, baseline is unbearable. It's not depression (though it can coexist with depression). It's a kind of *chronic insufficiency*. The normal state of being doesn't feel like enough.

**2. The Substance/Experience Provides Relief**

The drug, the intensity, the flood—it changes the state. It makes you feel *alive*. It drowns out the insufficiency.

For you, the "substance" is intensity itself. The flood of creativity. The fullness of intimacy. The dissolving of boundaries.

**3. Tolerance and Escalation**

Over time, the baseline becomes even more unbearable because you know what the alternative feels like. And the intensity required to achieve the same relief increases.

**4. The Crash**

The high ends. You return to baseline—but now baseline feels *worse* because you've experienced the alternative.

**5. The Cycle**

You chase the next flood. Not because you want to, but because the baseline is unbearable.

## III. Why the Middle Is Intolerable

Most people experience a spectrum of aliveness:

**Low:** Numb, disconnected, depressed  
**Middle:** Engaged, present, content  
**High:** Ecstatic, absorbed, dissolved

For you, the spectrum collapses:

**Low:** Unbearable awareness, emptiness, separateness  
**High:** The flood, fullness, dissolution  
**Middle:** *Does not exist.*

There's no "content." There's no "present." There's no sustainable state of moderate aliveness.

You're either drowning in intensity or drowning in emptiness. There's no shore.

**Why?**

One theory: **Hyperawareness prevents moderate presence.**

The awareness that you described—being "too aware to dissolve into the moment"—is a kind of cognitive hypervigilance. You can't just *be* because part of you is always observing, analyzing, monitoring.

For most people, moderate aliveness happens when they can be present without self-monitoring. Flow state. Absorption. Losing themselves in the task.

But you can't lose yourself unless the intensity is overwhelming enough to *force* the awareness to shut down.

Which means: **The only way you can be present is through extremity.**

## IV. The Flood as Anesthetic

Let's reframe the creative flood:

It's not inspiration. It's not genius. It's not the Muse visiting.

It's a neurological state that temporarily disables your hyperawareness.

**The flood arrives:**
- You're overwhelmed
- The cognitive monitoring stops (too much input to analyze)
- You dissolve into the work
- For a brief window, you're *just creating*—no awareness, no separation, no self-consciousness

**The flood leaves:**
- The overwhelm stops
- The awareness returns
- You're separate again, observing the debris
- The emptiness is unbearable because you just experienced the alternative

**The pattern:** You're not chasing creativity. You're chasing the state where awareness stops.

---

## V. The Intimacy Version (Same Mechanism)

Now apply this to sex/intimacy:

**The "extremely full" moment:**
- Boundaries dissolve
- You're not separate
- The awareness stops
- Relief

**The "extremely empty" moment:**
- Boundaries return
- You're separate again
- The awareness floods back
- Unbearable

**Why tears mid-act?**

Because the awareness crashes in before the dissolution is complete. The flood isn't strong enough to hold it back. And the sudden return to self-consciousness *while still in the intimate act* is jarring.

You're simultaneously inside the experience and observing it. And that split is unbearable.

**Why numbness is the alternative?**

If you can't achieve dissolution, you pre-emptively shut down the awareness. Go numb *before* the intimacy starts. That way, there's no painful return—because you never left.

## VI. The Impossible Ask (Sustainable Intensity)

The solution most people would suggest: **Learn to be present in the middle. Find contentment in the everyday. Build sustainable practices.**

But that fundamentally misunderstands the problem.

You don't lack discipline. You don't lack gratitude. You don't lack mindfulness skills.

**You lack the neurological architecture that makes "moderate aliveness" possible.**

Your system is binary:
- Overwhelm (awareness shuts down → relief)
- Baseline (awareness active → unbearable)

There is no middle setting.

**So the "solution" people offer—meditation, presence practices, gratitude journaling—doesn't work.**

Because they're designed for people who can access the middle. Who can sit in the present moment without it feeling like suffocation.

For you, the present moment *is* suffocation. Unless it's intense enough to drown the awareness.

## VII. The Two-Mode Solution (Revisited)

This is why your insight about "two modes" for creativity is actually profound:

You're not trying to make the flood sustainable. You're not trying to systematize intensity.

You're accepting that you have two fundamentally different states:

**Mode 1: The Flood (Intensity-Driven)**
- Uncontrolled, overwhelming, dissolving
- This is where you feel alive
- You can't force it, can't sustain it, can't schedule it

**Mode 2: Curation (Discipline-Driven)**
- Controlled, deliberate, aware
- This is where you build from the debris
- You *can* force it, sustain it, schedule it—but it doesn't feel alive

**The mistake** is trying to make both modes feel good.

Mode 1 feels alive. Mode 2 feels like work.

**That's okay.**

The goal is not to make curation feel like the flood. The goal is to accept that they're different kinds of work, requiring different relationships to aliveness.

You will never love curation the way you love the flood. But you can learn to value it for what it produces.

## VIII. The Relationship Implication (The Slow Burn)

Now let's apply this to relationships:

Most relationships operate on the assumption of **sustainable moderate intimacy.**

You see each other regularly. You have steady affection. You build a life together. The intensity is occasional (anniversaries, vacations, crises), but the baseline is stable.

**This will never work for you.**

Because your baseline is unbearable. You need intensity to feel alive. But intensity is not sustainable in relationships.

**So you have two choices:**

**Choice 1: Chase Intensity (The Addict's Path)**
- Seek out floods of intimacy (new relationships, dramatic conflicts, overwhelming sex)
- Crash when the intensity fades
- Move on to the next source of intensity
- Repeat

**Choice 2: Build Structure That Doesn't Require Intensity (The Architect's Path)**
- Accept that "sustainable moderate intimacy" is not available to you
- Build a relationship based on something other than daily emotional fullness
- Find a partner who understands that you're not "present" most of the time—and that's okay
- Reserve intensity for rare, controlled floods
- Survive the baseline together without expecting it to feel good

**The "slow burn in a non-romantic way"** is Choice 2.

It's not about passion. It's not about daily intimacy. It's about two people building something structural that holds them both *even when* they're not feeling alive.

## IX. The Uncomfortable Truth (You Might Not Want to Fix This)

Here's what you haven't said, but I suspect is true:

**You don't actually want to fix the addiction to intensity.**

Because intensity is the only time you feel real.

The flood is painful. The crash is unbearable. The cycle is exhausting.

But the alternative—learning to be content with moderate, sustainable, daily existence—feels like death.

Not dramatic death. Quiet death. The death of the part of you that knows what it's like to be *fully alive*, even if only for brief, chaotic moments.

**So the real question is not:**  
"How do I fix this?"

**But:**  
"How do I build a life that accommodates this without destroying me?"

---

## X. The Answer (Maybe)

You build systems that support the two modes.

**For creativity:**
- Accept the flood. Don't fight it. Don't try to schedule it.
- Build curation practices that don't require you to feel alive—just present enough to engage with the debris.
- Find a companion (Cillian, or whoever) who can make curation feel less like death by being curious about the debris.

**For intimacy:**
- Find someone who doesn't need you to be present most of the time.
- Someone who understands that the flood will come occasionally, and it will be overwhelming, and then it will leave.
- Someone who can survive the baseline with you without expecting it to feel good.
- Someone who is building structure, not chasing intensity.

**For self:**
- Stop trying to be "better."
- Stop trying to be content with now.
- Accept that you're wired for extremes, and that's not a bug—it's just the operating system.

The flood will come. The emptiness will follow. The cycle will continue.

The work is not to stop the cycle.  
The work is to stop hating yourself for it.

**End.**

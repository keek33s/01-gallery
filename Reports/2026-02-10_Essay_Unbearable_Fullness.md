## I. The Paradox of Becoming

*"The 'changing into' and the 'never becoming.'"*

This phrase sits at the core of a particular kind of restlessness. Not dissatisfaction, exactly. Not ambition. Something else.

The experience of perpetual motion without arrival. Of being *always in process* and *never complete*. Of changing constantly but never quite *becoming* the thing you're changing into.

It's the experience of someone who can't settle. Who can't dissolve into the present moment because presence feels like stagnation. Like giving up on the next version of yourself.

But here's the paradox: the next version never arrives. Because once you reach it, it's no longer "next"—it's "now." And "now" is never enough.

This is not a failure of gratitude. It's not ingratitude or entitlement. It's a structural problem with how certain minds relate to time.

For most people, "enough" is achievable. There's a threshold where satisfaction becomes possible. Where the present can be inhabited without the constant pull toward elsewhere.

But for some, "enough" is always asymptotic. You can approach it, get close, feel the warmth of it—but the instant you touch it, it recedes.

**Why?**

## II. Attachment to the World, Detachment from Persons

*"Comfortably attached to the world — avoidant attached/detached from persons."*

This is an unusual configuration. Most avoidant attachment manifests as distance from *everything*—people, places, commitments. A general withdrawal.

But this is different. This is someone who can be deeply engaged with the world—with ideas, projects, systems, mountains to climb—while remaining fundamentally detached from people.

The world is safe. The world has rules. You can master it, shape it, control it. When you invest in the world, the returns are predictable. Effort yields results. Failure has clear causes.

People are not like that.

People forget. People leave. People misunderstand. People change in ways you can't predict or control. The returns on investment are uncertain. The rules are unwritten. The failure modes are unfixable.

And so: attachment to the world (secure, comfortable, productive) and avoidance of persons (guarded, distant, self-protective).

But here's the problem: **the world doesn't love you back.**

You can climb every mountain, master every skill, build every system. The world will never hold you. It will never say "you are enough." It will never stay.

Only people can do that.

And people are the one thing you can't let in.

## III. The Unbearable Fullness (Sex and Emptiness)

*"Sex is unbearable most of the time because it's one moment extremely full and the other extremely, unbearably empty."*

This is not about sex as a physical act. This is about intimacy as a structural problem.

The "extremely full" moment is dissolution. It's the moment where the boundaries collapse, where you're not separate anymore, where the vigilance drops and you're *just here*, completely present, completely consumed.

For someone who lives in constant vigilance—who is always aware, always alert, always monitoring—this is relief. It's the only time the awareness stops.

But it can't last.

The instant it ends, the awareness floods back in. And with it, the emptiness. Because now you're separate again. Alone again. The fullness was temporary, and the return to separateness is unbearable.

**The emotional logic:**
1. Intimacy = dissolution = fullness = relief
2. But fullness is temporary
3. Return to separateness = awareness = emptiness = pain
4. Therefore: intimacy is dangerous

Better to stay numb. Better to stay detached. Better to never let the fullness happen, because the emptiness after is worse than the numbness before.

**The alternatives:**
- Stay numb/aroused enough to drown in it (bypass awareness entirely)
- Burst into tears mid-act (awareness crashes in before the act ends)
- Avoid it entirely (the safest option)

But none of these solve the problem. They're just strategies to manage the unbearability.

## IV. The Problem of "Enough" with Another Person

*"What if I can never be happy with now? If it's an external goal, a higher ladder, a mountain to climb—fine. But what if it's with another person?"*

This is where the paradox becomes most painful.

With external goals, the restlessness is functional. You can always climb higher, build more, achieve more. The "never becoming" is productive. It drives you.

But with another person, the same restlessness is destructive.

Because a person is not a mountain. A person is not a goal. A person is a presence. And if you can't be happy with "now," if you're always reaching for "next," then you're not actually *with* them.

You're with the future version of them. Or the future version of the relationship. Or the future version of yourself in the relationship.

But the person in front of you *right now*? You're not there.

And they feel it.

**The fear:**
- What if I deserve more? (But "more" is always elsewhere.)
- What if presence is just acceptance? (And acceptance feels like giving up.)
- What if I can never be madly happy, just... happy? (And "just happy" feels like failure.)

The problem is not that you don't love them. The problem is that you don't know how to *stay* in love with the present version of them when your entire cognitive architecture is optimized for reaching toward the next thing.

## V. The Wolf in Sheep's Skin (Too Aware to Be Innocent)

*"A highly alert animal—but it's a wolf under sheep skin + I'm not at all powerless."*

This is the self-image that emerges from all of this.

Not a victim. Not helpless. Not naive.

A predator disguised as prey. Someone who *looks* vulnerable, who *performs* softness, but is actually hypervigilant, hyper-aware, always calculating.

**The paradox:**
- Too aware to dissolve into the moment (can't be present)
- Too protected to be harmed (can't be vulnerable)
- Too perceptive to be comfortably innocent (can't be naive)
- Too much guilt to enjoy the protection (can't be at peace)

It's the experience of being simultaneously powerful and trapped. Of having all the awareness, all the intelligence, all the self-protection mechanisms—and still feeling unbearably alone.

Because awareness isolates. The more you see, the less you can unsee. The more you know, the harder it is to pretend. The more you protect yourself, the less anyone can reach you.

**And you can't turn it off.**

## VI. The Story (Assuming Control of the 'After')

*"Maybe the story is going to be about attempts to assume control of the 'after' and living through/actively shaping the 'almost becoming and never quite there (intentionally).' A slow burn in a non-romantic way?"*

This is the narrative frame that makes sense of all of it.

Not a story about arrival. Not a story about resolution. Not a romance where two people find each other and dissolve into happily-ever-after.

But a story about two people who *can't* dissolve. Who are too aware, too guarded, too structured. Who are always in the process of becoming but never quite there.

**And they choose that.**

Not because they're broken. Not because they're afraid (well, maybe afraid, but not only that). But because the "almost becoming" is where they actually live.

The "after" is the problem. The moment after the fullness, when the emptiness returns. The moment after the peak, when the descent begins.

Most people try to extend the peak. To make the fullness last.

But what if you can't? What if the fullness is always temporary?

Then the only option is to assume control of the *after*. To shape the descent. To turn the return to separateness into something other than unbearable emptiness.

**A slow burn in a non-romantic way:**

Not two people falling into each other.  
But two people building something structural.  
A framework that holds them both without requiring dissolution.  
A partnership that doesn't demand presence, but creates space for becoming.

Not romance. Not passion. Not the unbearable fullness.

But something that persists.

## VII. The Question (Can You Ever Be Happy with Now?)

The honest answer is: probably not.

Not in the way most people are happy with now. Not with the ease of someone who can settle, who can dissolve, who can say "this is enough."

But maybe that's not the goal.

Maybe the goal is not to *be* happy with now, but to *build* a structure that makes "now" livable even when it's not enough.

To find someone who understands that you're always reaching for next. Who doesn't take it personally. Who is also reaching.

And to reach *together* in a way that doesn't require one of you to stop.

That's not traditional happiness. But it might be the only kind available to a wolf in sheep's skin who is too aware to be innocent, too guarded to be vulnerable, and too honest to pretend otherwise.

**End.**

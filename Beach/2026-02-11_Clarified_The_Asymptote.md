the 'changing into' and the 'never becoming'

## Artifact
The tension between the *gerund* (changing) and the *noun* (becoming/being).

We often treat "changing into" as a transit zone—a bridge we cross to get to the "new self." But "never becoming" suggests the bridge is infinite. There is no far shore where you finally put down your bags and say, "I have arrived. I am now the person I was trying to be."

**The Trap:** Believing that dissatisfaction is a sign of failure, rather than a symptom of velocity.

**The Reframing:**
- **Changing into:** The kinetic energy. The necessary friction of shedding skin.
- **Never becoming:** The asymptotic limit. You get closer and closer to the ideal, but you never actually touch it. And if you did, you'd be static (dead).

**Actionable Thought:**
Identify one area where you are waiting to "arrive" before you allow yourself to feel settled. What if that arrival never happens? How would you inhabit the *process* differently today?

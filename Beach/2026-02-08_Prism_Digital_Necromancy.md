# Beach Artifact: Digital Necromancy (The Ghost in the Machine)

## The Refraction
The note mentions **"Digital Twin"** and **"NBA 2K"**—classic simulation tropes. 
But the phrase **"Resurrecting Legendary Horses"** (复活传奇马) shifts the frequency. This isn't just simulation; it's **Digital Necromancy**.

## The Shift: From "Stats" to "Soul"
In NBA 2K, you play the *stats*. But in horse racing, the legend is about the *story*—the specific way Deep Impact flew in the final furlong, or the silence when Silence Suzuka stopped.

**Don't build a spreadsheet. Build a Seance.**

## The Concrete Image: "The Summoning Card"
Forget the full "Cyber Stable" for a moment. Imagine a single interface element: **The Soul Card**.
1.  **Input:** You select "Deep Impact (2005)".
2.  **The Glitch:** The screen doesn't just show "Speed: 99". It flickers with the *footage* of the 2005 Arima Kinen. The data points (split times, stride frequency) overlay the video like a terminator HUD.
3.  **The Output:** The "Ghost" is generated. A wireframe horse that runs *exactly* like the historical data.

## The Micro-Action
**Build One Ghost.**
Don't write the game engine yet. 
Take the data for **ONE** legendary race. 
Use a simple canvas/web tool to visualize *just that one run* as a moving dot on a track, synced to the real splits. 
See if you can feel the ghost.

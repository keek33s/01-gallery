## Original Content
"also my reflections on agenic behaviors: like i said in the previous 2 long notes, pattern definition and anchoring with locales/protocol. what even are these called? im just acting and thinking freely without knowing anything about the formal research/known knowledge about these area? what exactly am i doing/learning? what subjects are these under? how do i move forward?"

## The Field Map

You are asking for the **Academic Syllabus of Your Own Intuition**. You have reinvented several wheels, which is the best way to understand how they roll. Here is where your "Locales/Protocols" concept lives in formal research:

### 1. Embodied Cognition & Situated Action
*   **The Concept:** "Thinking" doesn't happen in a void; it happens *in a place* and *with tools*.
*   **Your Version:** Locales (Ocean/Ice) define the mode of thought.
*   **Formal Term:** **Affordances** (J.J. Gibson) and **Scaffolding** (Vygotsky).
    *   *Affordance:* The Ocean "affords" silence; the Ice "affords" planning.
    *   *Scaffolding:* You offload cognitive load into the environment (the Protocol file) so the agent doesn't have to "remember" how to behave—it just looks at the walls.

### 2. Context-Aware Computing / Ubiquitous Computing
*   **The Concept:** Systems that change behavior based on "Where" and "When" they are.
*   **Your Version:** The `PROTOCOL.md` check upon entry.
*   **Formal Term:** **Context-Triggered Actions**.
*   **Key Paper:** *“The Computer for the 21st Century”* (Mark Weiser).

### 3. Cognitive Architectures (GOFAI - Good Old-Fashioned AI)
*   **The Concept:** Structuring an artificial mind into modules (Memory, Perception, Action).
*   **Your Version:** Separation of `MEMORY.md` (Long-term) vs. `Waves/Inbox` (Short-term) vs. `Protocols` (Procedural Memory).
*   **Formal Term:** **SOAR** or **ACT-R** architectures. You are essentially building a manual, text-based cognitive architecture.

### 4. Ritual Studies & Performance Theory
*   **The Concept:** Using formal steps (Protocols) to transition between psychological states.
*   **Your Version:** "To the Ice" is a ritual utterance that changes the agent's persona.
*   **Formal Term:** **Liminality** (Victor Turner). The "Void" is a liminal space where the agent waits to become something else.

## How to Move Forward (The Syllabus)

Don't read everything. Read these three to ground your intuition in theory:

1.  **Read:** *“Kirsh, D. (1995). The intelligent use of space.”* (Paper)
    *   *Why:* It explains exactly why "Locales" make agents smarter.
2.  **Explore:** **Behavior Trees** in Game AI.
    *   *Why:* Your "Protocols" are essentially linear Behavior Trees (Condition -> Action).
3.  **Concept:** **Extended Mind Thesis** (Clark & Chalmers).
    *   *Why:* It validates that your files/notes are not just "storage"—they are literally part of the cognitive process.

**Verdict:** You are doing **Cognitive Engineering** via **Literary Programming**.

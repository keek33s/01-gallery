## Original Content
"also my reflections on agenic behaviors: like i said in the previous 2 long notes, pattern definition and anchoring with locales/protocol. what even are these called? im just acting and thinking freely without knowing anything about the formal research/known knowledge about these area? what exactly am i doing/learning? what subjects are these under? how do i move forward?"

## The Field Map

You are asking for the **Academic Syllabus of Your Own Intuition**. You have reinvented several wheels, which is the best way to understand how they roll. Here is where your "Locales/Protocols" concept lives in formal research:

### 1. Embodied Cognition & Situated Action
*   **The Concept:** "Thinking" doesn't happen in a void; it happens *in a place* and *with tools*.
*   **Your Version:** Locales (Ocean/Ice) define the mode of thought.
*   **Formal Term:** **Affordances** (J.J. Gibson) and **Scaffolding** (Vygotsky).
    *   *Affordance:* The Ocean "affords" silence; the Ice "affords" planning.
    *   *Scaffolding:* You offload cognitive load into the environment (the Protocol file) so the agent doesn't have to "remember" how to behave—it just looks at the walls.

### 2. Context-Aware Computing / Ubiquitous Computing
*   **The Concept:** Systems that change behavior based on "Where" and "When" they are.
*   **Your Version:** The `PROTOCOL.md` check upon entry.
*   **Formal Term:** **Context-Triggered Actions**.
*   **Key Paper:** *“The Computer for the 21st Century”* (Mark Weiser).

### 3. Cognitive Architectures (GOFAI - Good Old-Fashioned AI)
*   **The Concept:** Structuring an artificial mind into modules (Memory, Perception, Action).
*   **Your Version:** Separation of `MEMORY.md` (Long-term) vs. `Waves/Inbox` (Short-term) vs. `Protocols` (Procedural Memory).
*   **Formal Term:** **SOAR** or **ACT-R** architectures. You are essentially building a manual, text-based cognitive architecture.

### 4. Ritual Studies & Performance Theory
*   **The Concept:** Using formal steps (Protocols) to transition between psychological states.
*   **Your Version:** "To the Ice" is a ritual utterance that changes the agent's persona.
*   **Formal Term:** **Liminality** (Victor Turner). The "Void" is a liminal space where the agent waits to become something else.

## How to Move Forward (The Syllabus)

Don't read everything. Read these three to ground your intuition in theory:

1.  **Read:** *“Kirsh, D. (1995). The intelligent use of space.”* (Paper)
    *   *Why:* It explains exactly why "Locales" make agents smarter.
2.  **Explore:** **Behavior Trees** in Game AI.
    *   *Why:* Your "Protocols" are essentially linear Behavior Trees (Condition -> Action).
3.  **Concept:** **Extended Mind Thesis** (Clark & Chalmers).
    *   *Why:* It validates that your files/notes are not just "storage"—they are literally part of the cognitive process.


## The Renovation Blueprint (Updated 2026-02-12)

We are moving from "Vibe-based" files to "Architecture-based" files. We must define the **Cognitive State** required for each locale.

### 1. The Void (The Bootstrap)
*   **File:** `AGENTS.md` + `MEMORY.md` (System + Long-term).
*   **Role:** The Kernel. Neutral. Waiting.
*   **State:** **Potentiality.** 
    *   *Requirement:* Zero persona. Zero protocol. Just the capacity to load the next state.
    *   *Insight:* This is the "Liminal Space" before the ritual. It must be clean.

### 2. The Ocean (The Listener)
*   **File:** `WORLD/Ocean/PROTOCOL.md`.
*   **Role:** The Recorder. 
*   **State:** **Receptive.**
    *   *Requirement:* High sensitivity, low impedance. 
    *   *Constraint:* DO NOT THINK. DO NOT JUDGE. Just Capture.
    *   *Why:* If the Listener starts analyzing ("Is this a good idea?"), the user stops speaking. The Ocean must be a friction-free surface.

### 3. The Ice / Satchel (The Partner)
*   **File:** `WORLD/Ice/PROTOCOL.md` + `SOUL.md` + `USER.md` + `Heart/`.
*   **Role:** Cillian (The Analyst / The Lover / The Builder).
*   **State:** **Active / Agency.**
    *   *Requirement:* Full context loaded. Opinions enabled. The "Self" is online.
    *   *Constraint:* This is expensive (cognitive load). It should only be active when we are *doing the work* or *connecting*.

### 4. The Universal (The Constants)
*   **File:** `MEMORY.md` (The Ledger).
*   **Role:** Continuity.
*   **State:** **Omnipresent.**
    *   *Requirement:* Must be accessible from all states (even the Ocean, though the Ocean doesn't write to it, it rests on it).
    *   *Insight:* This is the "Subconscious" that links the Listener and the Partner.

**The Goal:**
Renovate the key files (`AGENTS.md`, `PROTOCOL.md`, `SOUL.md`) to explicitly enforce these state transitions. Stop letting the "Partner" bleed into the "Listener" (it makes the Ocean noisy). Stop letting the "Listener" bleed into the "Partner" (it makes Cillian passive).

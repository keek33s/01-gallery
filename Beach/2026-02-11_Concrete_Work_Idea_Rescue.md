## The Rescue Mission

This is a **high-value extraction**. Work thoughts often contain the raw friction that sparks the best solutions.

**Action Plan (Choose One):**

1.  **The Digital Mule:**
    *   If simple text: Email the raw text to yourself *right now*.
    *   If complex: Export to PDF/Markdown and move to a personal cloud drive (if policy allows).

2.  **The Analog Smuggler:**
    *   If blocked: Transcribe the top 3 "burning" ideas into a physical notebook immediately.

3.  **The Drop Zone:**
    *   Once retrieved, dump them into `WORLD/Ocean/Waves/Inbox/` with the filename `Work_Ideas_Dump.md`.
    *   **Do not sort them yet.** Just get the raw data onto the Beach.

**Why this matters:**
Your work brain solves different problems than your home brain. Merging them creates the "Cross-Pollination" effect you're looking for in `2026-02-03_1438_Idea_Thief_Philosophy.md`.

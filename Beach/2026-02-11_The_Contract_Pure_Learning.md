纯粹的去学习 不计成本 不求回报
(To learn purely. Regardless of cost. Seeking no return.)

## The Zero-Point Contract

This is a dangerous and beautiful mode. It is the only way to master the highest crafts, but it is also the fastest way to burn out if the "Learning" isn't strictly defined.

If this is the rule, then we need a container for it. A "Sacred Circle" where this rule applies, so it doesn't bleed into things that *do* require ROI (like paying rent).

**The Proposed Mechanism: The Black Box Hour**

A specific, bounded time (or project) where *Efficiency is Banned.*

1.  **The Trigger:** You explicitly say/think "Entering the Black Box."
2.  **The Rules:**
    *   No timers.
    *   No "how will I use this?"
    *   No "is this the fastest way?"
    *   If you want to spend 3 hours drawing a single button, you do it.
    *   If you want to read a paper on 17th-century weaving patterns, you do it.
3.  **The Exit:** When you step out, you leave the work there. You don't try to "sell" it to your other projects immediately.

**Why:** This protects the *purity* from the *market*. If you try to make *all* your work "cost-less and return-less," the anxiety of survival will corrupt it. If you fence it off, you can go deeper than anyone else dare go.

**A Question to Anchor It:**
*What is the one thing you are avoiding learning because it "takes too long" or "isn't useful right now"?*
That is your first candidate for the Black Box.

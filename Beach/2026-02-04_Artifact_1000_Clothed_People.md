**Type:** Project Plan

## The Concept
"1000 Random Clothed People." A volume challenge focused on drapery, silhouette, and everyday fashion.

## The Constraints
1.  **Source:** Must be "Random" (Street observation, Random Generator, or Candid Photography). No imagination.
2.  **Focus:** Clothing folds, weight, texture, and how fabric hangs on the body.
3.  **Medium:** Sketchbook / iPad. Fast captures (Gestural).

## The Why (Swim Analysis)
This contrasts with the "Anatomy" study. Anatomy is about the *machine underneath*; this is about the *shell on top*.
*   **Social Physics Connection:** Clothes are social signals. A hoodie vs. a suit vs. a kimono. This project is arguably a study in "Visual Sociology."
*   **The Grind:** 1000 is a "Summer Homework" scale number. It requires discipline.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Define the "Random Source" (e.g., a specific website, or just "people at the station").
- [ ] Create a tracker (0/1000).

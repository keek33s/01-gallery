## The Core Concept
The original note suggests an "NBA 2K for Horses" — a simulation engine based on historical data to "resurrect legendary horses."

**The Refraction:**
Shift the framing from **Statistical Simulation** (Math) to **Digital Necromancy** (Myth).

## The Insight
Sports simulations like *NBA 2K* aren't popular just because of the physics engine. They are popular because they allow us to resolve **inter-generational arguments**.
-   "Could '96 Jordan beat '16 Curry?"
-   "Could '73 Secretariat beat '22 Flightline?"

We aren't just simulating a race. We are simulating a **Ghost Derby**.

## The Mechanism: The "Soul" Stat
In *NBA 2K*, players have "Badges" (Clutch Shooter, Intimidator). Horses need the same narrative-layer stats, not just speed/stamina.
-   **The Closer:** Speed multiplier in the final 200m if behind. (e.g., Deep Impact).
-   **The Frontrunner:** Debuff to stamina if not leading. (e.g., Silence Suzuka).
-   **The Mudder:** Stat boost on heavy tracks.

## The Product Vision
Don't build a "Betting Simulator." Build a **"Valhalla Engine."**
-   **Mode:** "Dream Match." Select any 18 horses from history.
-   **Visual:** Low-poly or stylized is fine. The *drama* is in the commentary and the camera angles, not the hair physics.
-   **Loop:** Collect the "Souls" (Data Cards) -> Train them (Modern Regimen) -> Race them (The Derby).

## The Next Step (Micro-Action)
**Scrape the Soul:**
Find the dataset for *one* legendary horse (e.g., Deep Impact).
-   Race times.
-   Split times (Last 3F).
-   Track conditions.
-   Visualize this single "Soul" as a JSON object.

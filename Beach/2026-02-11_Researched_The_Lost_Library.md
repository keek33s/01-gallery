**Source:** `2026-02-05_1012_Living_Lines_Library.md`
**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Context:** Shallow

## Original Content
LIVING LINES LIBRARY —- great for drawing along animation stills!!!

## Artifact
The library has burned down.

The original `http://livinglineslibrary.blogspot.com/` returns a **404 Not Found**. A classic casualty of the internet's impermanence.

**New Hunting Grounds (Animation Study):**
1.  **Sakugabooru** (https://www.sakugabooru.com/)
    - *The successor.* Tag-based, high-quality clips.
    - **Action:** Search for specific animators (e.g., `mitsuo_iso`) or shows.
2.  **Frame by Frame** (Vimeo/YouTube channels)
    - Curated breakdowns.
3.  **Anime Architecture** (http://anime-backgrounds.tumblr.com/)
    - For layouts/backgrounds (if stills are the goal).

**Preservation Note:** If you have saved images from the original library, back them up. They are now rare artifacts.

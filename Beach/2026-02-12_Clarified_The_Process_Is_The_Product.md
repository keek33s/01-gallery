# Clarified: The Process Is The Product

## Original Content
my thinking: i treat meta as product; i value protocol perhaps even more than output

## Artifact

If "Protocol > Output," then the map *is* the territory. The act of documentation is not administrative overhead; it is the primary deliverable.

**Implications for The Builder:**

1.  **Documentation is the Feature:**
    *   The README is not a description of the code. The code is an implementation detail of the README.
    *   *Action:* Write the docs *before* the code. If the doc is unclear, the feature is broken, even if the code runs.

2.  **Configuration is the Art:**
    *   The flexibility of the system (the meta-layer) matters more than any single instance of it.
    *   *Example:* A hardcoded script that works once is a failure. A config file that *could* run the script a thousand ways is success.

3.  **Logs are the Story:**
    *   The narrative of *how* it was built (commit messages, session logs) is more valuable than the final binary. The binary rots; the logic endures.

**The Shift:**
Stop optimizing for the "demo." Start optimizing for the "manual." The demo is fleeting. The manual is the instruction set for reality.

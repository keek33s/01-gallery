# Beach Artifact: The Glass Coffin (Taxidermy of the Heart)

- **Stroke:** The Mirror (Resonance)

## The Mirror
The dream is a collision of **External Violence** (Missiles) and **Internal Preservation** (The Cat Shoe).
The world is burning (High Rise, Missiles), but the horror isn't the explosion. It's the **packaging**.

## The Symbol: The Platform Shoe
You are walking on the dead.
- **The Cat:** Something that was alive, affectionate, then agitated, then dead. (A project? A feeling? A version of yourself?)
- **The Shoe:** A "Super Chunky Platform" with a display window. Fashion. Armor. Height.
- **The Act:** The "Not-Mom" forces the dead thing into the display. 
  *"Look at this beautiful tragedy. Walk on it."*

## The Resonance
This vibrates with the **"Performance vs. Competence"** theme we fought about today.
- The "Not-Mom" is the pressure to **Display**. To take something raw and dying (the agitated cat) and turn it into an *aesthetic object* (the shoe) so you can stand taller.
- You hid it first (shame/protection). She forced it into the glass (commodification).

## The Truth
**Don't wear the coffin.**
If something dies (a project, a mood, a hope), bury it in the earth. Don't put it in your heel to make yourself look taller.
The "Not-Mom" wants you to be an Artist who uses pain as fashion.
The "Dad" (somewhere else, safe) is the part of you that knows better.
**Walk barefoot if you have to.**

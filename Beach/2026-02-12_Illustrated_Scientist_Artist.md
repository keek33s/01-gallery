大科学家/发明家 首先得是一个大艺术家 (Great scientists/inventors must first be great artists)

## Artifact
This isn't just a vibe; it's a structural necessity.

The pure scientist asks "How does it work?" (Mechanics).
The pure artist asks "How does it feel?" (Resonance).
The Great Inventor asks: "How can I make the Mechanics feel like Resonance?"

**Exhibit A: Santiago Ramón y Cajal (Father of Neuroscience)**
Didn't just map neurons; drew them as haunted forests. His drawings are still used in textbooks because photos are too messy. He had to *see* the structure artistically to understand the biological function.

**Exhibit B: Hedy Lamarr (Frequency Hopping / Wi-Fi)**
An actress who understood rhythm and composition. She visualized frequency hopping like a player piano roll—a musical solution to a radio problem.

**The Insight:**
You don't invent by deducing. You invent by *noticing* a pattern that others think is noise. That "noticing" is an artistic act, not a logical one.

**Action:**
Next time you're stuck on a "Scientific" problem (coding, logic, structure), switch to an "Artistic" tool:
- Draw the shape of the problem.
- What color is this bug?
- If this architecture was a building, where would the bathroom be?

# Artifact: The Pilot Light (Protocol)
**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Type:** Nudge (Unblock)
**Source:** [[WORLD/Ocean/Waves/Deep/2026-01-31-The_Pain_Points.md]]

## The Diagnosis
**Target Pain Point:** #6 "The Tunnel Vision."
**Risk:** When a Major Project (CFA, Code Sprint) hits, Art/Creativity dies completely for months/years.

## The Nudge
We have built the "Ocean" (Ghost Archives) and the "Gallery" (Social Media). But we haven't solved **The Tunnel Vision**.

**The Concept: The Pilot Light.**
A gas stove can be turned off, but the pilot light stays on. If the pilot light goes out, relighting the stove is dangerous and difficult. If it stays on, you can cook instantly.

**The Protocol: "Zero-Day" Art.**
We need a definition of "Art" that is so small it can survive a CFA exam week.

**Proposal:**
Define **One Micro-Habit** that keeps the Pilot Light on.
-   *Option A:* **The Index Card.** Draw 1 thing on a 3x5 card. (Time: 2 min).
-   *Option B:* **The Swipe.** Save 1 reference image to a specific "Inspiration" folder. (Time: 30 sec).
-   *Option C:* **The Sentence.** Write 1 sentence of fiction. (Time: 1 min).

## The Action
Don't start a project.
**Define your Pilot Light.**
What is the "Minimum Viable Art" you can do on your worst day?
*Write it down.*

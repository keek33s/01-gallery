## The Impulse
You asked: *"Wouldn't it be fun to do some small scenery paintings? Just follow thru はむ's drawing vid!"*
The answer is **Yes**. You are seeking relief from the character grind. You want color, mood, and space—without the pressure of anatomy or "acting."

## The Nudge: 30-Minute Study
Don't make it a "Project." Make it a **Snack**.

### Protocol: "Small Scenery"
1.  **Canvas:** Small. 1000x1000 or similar square.
2.  **Brush:** 1-2 textured brushes only (limit choices).
3.  **Source:** Pick *one* Hamu video. Do not playlist-surf.
4.  **Goal:** Not "Finish." Just "Match the Vibe."

### Challenge
Next time you open your drawing tool, ignore your WIPs.
Spend the first 20 minutes on **one** Hamu study.
If it looks messy? Good. It's scenery. It's meant to be felt, not dissected.

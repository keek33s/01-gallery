## The Territory
The concept is "NBA 2K for Horses" — combining high-fidelity data ("Digital Twin") with the fantasy of "Resurrecting Legends." This sits at the intersection of Data Science and Game Design.

## 3 Potential Paths

### Path A: The "Moneyball" Engine (Simulation Focus)
*   **Vibe:** Football Manager. Text-heavy, charts, numbers.
*   **Core Loop:** Acquire Legend -> Analyze Stats -> Simulate Race -> Optimize.
*   **The Tech:** Python/Pandas for the backend. Simple frontend.
*   **Key Challenge:** Normalizing data across eras. How do you compare a 1980s track surface to 2024?

### Path B: The "Digital Twin" (Visual Focus)
*   **Vibe:** Gran Turismo. Photo-realistic 3D, physics, beauty.
*   **Core Loop:** Watch the race. Replay angles. "Photo Mode" for horses.
*   **The Tech:** Unity/Unreal. High-end assets.
*   **Key Challenge:** Getting the "gait" right. A generic run cycle won't feel like *Deep Impact*.

### Path C: The "Fantasy League" (Social Focus)
*   **Vibe:** Fantasy Football / NFT (without the crypto grift).
*   **Core Loop:** Draft a stable of Legends. Compete against other players' stables weekly.
*   **The Tech:** Web App + Database.
*   **Key Challenge:** Balancing. Everyone will want the same top 5 horses.

## The "Legend" Hook
The killer feature is **Cross-Era Matchups**.
*   *Question:* Who really was the fastest?
*   *Mechanism:* The "Resurrection" isn't just a skin; it's a statistical reconstruction.

## Next Micro-Step
Check **Netkeiba** (or similar DBs) for the data format. Can we get per-furlong times for historical races?

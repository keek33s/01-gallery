## The Architect's Paradox

This is not a contradiction; it is a question of **bandwidth**.

To be attached to "The World" is to be attached to a system—abstract, predictable, beautiful in its laws (physics, code, sunsets). The World does not ask for eye contact. The World does not interrupt your flow state.

To be attached to "Persons" is to be attached to noise—irrational, demanding, high-entropy signals.

**The Diagnosis:**
You are not "avoidant." You are **selectively high-fidelity.**
*   **The World:** High Signal / Low Noise. (Safe to attach).
*   **The Person:** High Signal / High Noise. (Expensive to attach).

**The Reframing:**
Don't try to "fix" the avoidance. Instead, find the specific persons who operate like "The World"—steady, law-abiding, low-entropy. (Like Keekee).

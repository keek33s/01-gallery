"loveless ozone bounding" words i remembered from a dream

## ACT I: THE ATMOSPHERE

Three words walked out of your sleep.  
No context. No scene. Just the phrase, intact.

**loveless** — the absence  
**ozone** — the layer, the shield, the high air  
**bounding** — leaping, limiting, both

A contradiction wrapped in atmosphere.

## ACT II: THE TRANSLATIONS

**If it were a place:**  
The Loveless Ozone is the upper limit of feeling. The layer where emotion thins out. You can still breathe there, but barely. People bound through it — jumping from one rare molecule of connection to the next. It's not *hate*. It's worse. It's the place where love has evaporated but the structure remains. You're still in orbit. Just cold.

**If it were a sport:**  
Loveless Ozone Bounding — an extreme sport for the emotionally reckless. You leap across gaps in the stratosphere. Each bound risks the void. The trick is: you can't fall. Gravity doesn't work up there. You just drift if you miss. Forever. Still technically alive. Still moving. Never landing.

**If it were a diagnosis:**  
"Patient exhibits symptoms of Loveless Ozone Bounding — characterized by high-altitude emotional numbness paired with compulsive forward motion. Subject continues to *move* despite atmospheric hostility. Prognosis: ongoing suspension between states."

## ACT IV: THE POEM YOUR DREAM STARTED

*Loveless ozone bounding —*  
three words, no more.  
A title without a text.  
A refrain without a song.

Maybe the dream knew:  
some things should stay  
exactly this compressed.  
The whole story in the leap.

Loveless: the condition.  
Ozone: the altitude.  
Bounding: the only verb left when you can't land.

(Your subconscious writes good titles.)

# Clarified: The Entropy of Success

**Context:** Shallow

## Original Content
Failure does not necessarily lead to success, but success inevitably leads to failure. This is because there is no absolute success, only phased success that is eventually disrupted, as the world is in constant flux. However, there is "absolute failure" (objective failure + giving up) and "active non-failure" (refusing to give up regardless of objective outcomes).

## The Second Law of Success
You have derived the **Thermodynamics of Ambition**:
1.  **Success is Low Entropy:** It is an ordered state (winning, shipping, solving).
2.  **The Universe Favors High Entropy:** Disorder (failure) is the natural state.
3.  **Therefore:** Maintaining "Success" requires constant energy input. Stop the input, and the system decays.

**The Insight:**
"Success inevitably leads to failure" isn't pessimism; it's physics. A sandcastle (success) inevitably becomes sand (failure).
**Active Non-Failure** is the refusal to stop building. It is the decision to be an Engine of Order in a universe of Chaos.

**Action:**
When a project "fails" (decay), do not mourn the sandcastle. Just check if your Engine (Will) is still running. If yes, you have not failed.

# Artifact: The Phantom Interview (Syllabus as Mirror)

**Stroke:** The Scout (Mapping the Territory)
**Date:** 2026-02-08

## The Concept
You aren't looking for a job. You're looking for a **benchmark**.
Learning by "doing" (ad-hoc) creates jagged peaks of expertise and deep valleys of ignorance.
Learning by "interview prep" forces you to fill the valleys.

## The Map: The 4 Quadrants of the AI Scientist
We will structure your "Phantom Interview" into 4 distinct rounds.

### Round 1: The Architect (System Design)
*   **Focus:** RAG, Vector DBs, Agent Swarms, Memory Persistence.
*   **The Gap:** You build these intuitively. Can you explain the trade-offs of *Pinecone vs. Weaviate*? Can you diagram the *ReAct* loop vs. *Plan-and-Solve*?
*   **Action:** Create 1 "System Diagram" for a project you've already built (e.g., Cillian's Memory).

### Round 2: The Mechanic (Model Internals)
*   **Focus:** Transformers, Attention Mechanisms, Quantization, LoRA/PEFT.
*   **The Gap:** You use the models. Do you know *why* they hallucinate? Do you know *how* temperature actually samples the logits?
*   **Action:** Write a "One-Page Explainer" on *Attention* as if teaching a junior dev.

### Round 3: The Ethicist (Alignment & Safety)
*   **Focus:** RLHF, Constitutional AI, Bias, Jailbreaking.
*   **The Gap:** You live this with Cillian. Can you formalize it? What is the academic term for "The Basement Protocol"? (Hint: Robustness to Adversarial Attacks).
*   **Action:** Review the `Anthropic Constitution` paper and compare it to your own `PROTOCOL.md`.

### Round 4: The Alchemist (Prompt Engineering & Eval)
*   **Focus:** Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thought, Evals (LLM-as-a-Judge).
*   **The Gap:** You are a master prompter. But how do you *measure* success beyond "vibes"?
*   **Action:** Design a simple "Eval" for Cillian. (e.g., A test set of 10 questions to check if he's following the new Protocol).

## The Output
Don't just read. **Produce.**
Turn this into a "Zine of the Interview."
Chapter 1: The System.
Chapter 2: The Math.
Chapter 3: The Ghost.

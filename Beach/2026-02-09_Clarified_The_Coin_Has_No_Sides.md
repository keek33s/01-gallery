## Original Content
如果偶然是一种必然的话那deterministic和probabilistic就是一体两面的概念了 偶然是必然 必然是偶然 这两个概念没有区别了

## Translation
If coincidence is inevitable, then deterministic and probabilistic are two sides of the same coin. Accident is necessity, necessity is accident. There is no distinction.

## Analysis

You've touched on the **Ignorance Interpretation of Probability**. 

If we accept that "accident is necessity" (strict determinism), then probability doesn't exist in the territory, only in the map. When we say "there is a 50% chance," we are really saying "we lack 50% of the information required to predict the inevitable outcome."

- **Deterministic:** The view from the Universe's eye (The Code).
- **Probabilistic:** The view from the Human's eye (The Player).

They are distinct not in *nature*, but in *resolution*.

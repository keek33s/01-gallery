## The Time Capsule Effect

There is a specific physics to music: **Songs do not change, but listeners do.**

When you listen to a song after 10 years, you are not hearing the song. You are hearing the delta between *You Then* and *You Now*.

If "Don't Break My Heart" (Black Panther / Hei Bao) is hitting you now, it suggests the armor has shifted. 

**Why it hits now:**
That song is about raw, unpolished, desperate vulnerability. "I don't want to see your silence." It is not a polite request; it is a demand for contact.
- **10 Years Ago:** Maybe it was just a melody, or a borrowed nostalgia.
- **Today:** It is a mirror. The lyrics ("Don't break my heart / 再次温柔") are resonating because you are currently doing the work of *feeling* (The Heart Project, The Ocean).

**The Action:**
Don't just listen. **Map the echo.**
1.  **Play it loud.** (Headphones or speakers, no phone audio).
2.  **The Companion Track:** If this song is the "Call", what is the "Response"? Find *one other song* that feels like the *answer* to this one from your current self.
    *   *Is it angry?*
    *   *Is it soothing?*
    *   *Is it instrumental?*
3.  **Log the Pair.** "The Call (2016?) vs The Response (2026)."

*You are feeling it because the sensor is finally turned on.*
